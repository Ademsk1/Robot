# Robot
Controllable robot through flask application
The flask application is hosted on a Raspberry Pi 4, that has it's motors connected to pins: left=(27, 22), right=(17, 18), but can be adjusted on line 15 of app.py. 
This project is in it's early stages. Current progress is being made on integrating a ultrasound sensor to detect walls, and a camera for livestreaming the robots view.
